# Medical Expense Reimbursement Application

This project is a application designed to simplify the process of reimbursing employees for medical expenses. By enabling employees to fill out a form detailing their medical expenses, the application automatically routes the information to the HR department for approval. After the HR Approval or Rejection, it will pop up in records.

## Technologies Used

- **Appian**: The application is built using the Appian low-code platform for rapid development and deployment.
- **Database**: The application utilizes a database to store and manage employee and reimbursement data.
- **Integration**: Integration with HR systems and other relevant platforms for seamless data exchange.
